Module for defining the utility function to be used throughout command line testing.
The override_input_function_with_input_sequence replaces calls to input() in the program with a sequence of inputs
which are yielded by a generator.

    Function to replace print with when testing command line game - a function that does nothing.

    We replace the input function with a call to next on a generator that generates the desired input sequence.
    Here a generator expression is used because it's more succinct, however a generator function could equivalently be
    used, which yields the nth value in the input_sequence.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    monkeypatch: pytest tool used to override functions when testing
    list_of_values: The list of the user input sequence we would like to test a given method with

    ----------
    input() function calls are overriden by list_of_values
    print() function calls are nullified
