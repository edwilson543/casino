        player_data_directory_path: A Path object that specifies where the player and guest data is / will be stored,
        relative to the ROOT_DIRECTORY. This can easily be changed from the default if a user would like to store their
        player data elsewhere.

        player_data_file_name: Name of the player datafile - note that new player data files could be created by
        changing this string, although the JSON extension must always be used.
        The player datafile with the default name and default path is in the .gitignore, however will automatically
