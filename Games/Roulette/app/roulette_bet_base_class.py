""" Separated this out because the RouletteBet base class uses RouletteWheel object as a class attribute,
so it felt a bit messy to have the two base class defintions in the same module.
No doubt there is a better way of doing this - in particular this class definition relies on the wheel_options 
dictionary, which we talked about getting rid of.
I think the key problems to consider are:
1) Need to be able to calculate payout for all bets, which is defined using RouletteWheel bias_wheel_size method
2) Need to be able to set the playing wheel for the net, which relies on the wheel_options dictionary"""
